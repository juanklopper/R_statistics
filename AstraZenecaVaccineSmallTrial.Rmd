## Introduction

In this notebook, we simulate the results from a paper on the outcome of the use of the first Astra Zeneca vaccine for SARS-CoV-2. This trial recruited healthy, sero-negative (younger) individuals for randomization to placebo or vaccine administration. Cases of COVID-19 were recorded commencing two weeks after the second administration of the vaccine or placebo. At the time of recording, the paper available at https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.02.10.21251247v1 

## Pertinant points from study

* The primary endpoint was efficacy against NAAT-confirmed symptomatic Covid-19 occurring more than 14 days after the 2nd injection in participants who were seronegative at randomization.
* For the primary efficacy analyses, only per-protocol seronegative participants were included. Vaccine efficacy was calculated as 1- the relative risk and 95% CI were calculated using the Clopper-Pearson exact method are reported.
* Overall, 1,010 participants received vaccine and 1,011 received placebo.  There were 1,467 (750 vaccinees and 717 placebo) Covid-19- naive participants eligible for the primary VE analysis.
* The median age was 31 years, 56.5% identified as male gender, and the racial distribution included 70.5% black-Africans, 12.8% whites and 14.9% identifying as “mixed” race. Nineteen percent of enrolees were obese (BMI≥30-40 kg/m2), 42.0% were smokers, 2.8% had underlying hypertension and 3.1% had chronic respiratory conditions. The median duration between doses was 28 days; and the median duration of follow-up from enrolment and from 14 days after the second dose of injection were 156 and 121 days, respectively.
* All forty-two endpoint cases were graded either as mild (vaccinees=15; placebo-recipients=17) or moderate (vaccinees=4; placebo-recipients=6) with no cases of severe disease or hospitalization in either arm.
* The incidence (per 1000 person-years) of Covid-19 more than 14 days after the 2nd dose among sero-negative participants, and subsequent NAAT confirmed infection through to 14 days post second injection, was 93.6 and 73.1 in placebo and vaccine recipients, respectively.

Based on the findings of this study, the roll-out of the vaccine was discontinued in South Africa.

In the code below, we calculate the relative risk and use resampling to calculate confidence intervals for the relative risk.

## Code

We start with the sample sizes.

```{r Sample and affected sizes}
n_control <- 717
n_treatment <- 750

a_control <- 17 + 6 # Mild and moderate cases
a_treatment <- 15 + 4
```

Next, we calculate the risk for each group.

```{r Risk in each group}
risk_control <- a_control / n_control

risk_treatment <- a_treatment / n_treatment
```

From this follows the relative risk and efficacy.

```{r Relative risk}
relative_risk <- risk_treatment / risk_control
relative_risk
```

```{r Efficacy}
efficacy <- 1 - relative_risk
efficacy
```

As in the main notebook, we create a function to simulate risk given a sample size and probability of developing COVID-19.

```{r Simulating a positve outcome}
simulate_group <- function(n, p){
  xs = runif(n)
  k = sum(xs < p)
  return(k / n)
}
```

We also use the function that simulates the relative risk and returns the efficacy.

```{r Two group risk simulation}
simulate_trial <- function(n1, p1, n2, p2){
  risk1 = simulate_group(n1, p1)
  risk2 = simulate_group(n2, p2)
  efficacy = 1 - risk2 / risk1
  return(efficacy)
}
```

A single trial is simulated below.

```{r Running the trial once}
p1 <- a_control / n_control
p2 <- a_treatment / n_treatment
simulate_trial(n_control, p1, n_treatment, p2)
```

Now we simulate $1000$ trials and capture the relative risk of each.

```{r Simulating 1000 trials}
t2 <- comprehenr::to_vec(for (i in 1:1000) simulate_trial(n_control, p1, n_treatment, p2))
```

A density plot visualizes the relative risk values.

```{r KDE plot of relative risk}
density <- density(t2)

fig <- plot_ly(
  x = ~density$x,
  y = ~density$y,
  type = 'scatter',
  mode = 'lines',
  fill = 'tozeroy')
fig <- fig %>% layout(
  title = "Kernel density estimate",
  xaxis = list(title = "Efficacy",
               zeroline = F),
  yaxis = list(title = "Density")
)

fig
```

It remains to calculate the $95$% confidence intervals for the efficacy.

```{r Ninety five percent CI around the efficacy}
t2_uncertainty <- unname(quantile(t2, probs = c(0.025, 0.975)))
t2_uncertainty
```

Comment below on what you think about these confidence intervals.
